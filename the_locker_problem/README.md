A high school has a strange principal. On the first day, she had her students preform an odd opening day ceremony.

There are one thousand lockers and one thousand students in the school. 
The principal asks the first student to go and open every single locker. 
Then she has the second student go to every  second locker and close  it.
The third student goes to every third locker and, if it is closed open it, and if it is open, they close it. 
The fourth student does this to every fourth locker
... and so on and so forth
After the process is complete with the thousandth student, how many lockers are open?

There are 688 open lockers left
