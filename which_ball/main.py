# split the balls into 3 groups
# 1 will have 2 balls and the others will have 3
# we then compare 3 v 3 on our first use of the scale

# if the 2 groups of 3 weigh the same, we can then use our
# second use of the scale to compare the two balls in the first group
# whichever is heavier is our solution

# else if one group of 3 weighs more, than we will
# use our second use of the scale to compare two of the 3 balls
# if the two weigh the same, than the one not being measured is our answer
# elif one weighs more than another. Then the one that weighs more is 
# our solutions.
